This project will include the contributor/patron agreement templates. 
To consider: There will be a base agreement applied to all roles that support the Clinic and a second agreement based on the specific role (patron, student, professor, etc.) that could be selected with a drop down menu. This will allow specific considerations for each role rather than specific agreements for each role (a sort of 1.1.1 - 1.1.2 - 1.1.3)
Kyle's input: Necessary to include an open source philosophy and have signatories acknowledge public nature (non-confidentiality) of the efforts of the Clinic (Youtube, communications with third parties, etc.), as well as none of the communications being legal advise
Important influences are Optimism's governance documents: (https://www.optimism.io/build) / (https://docs.optimism.io/) / (https://community.optimism.io/welcome/welcome-overview) / (https://www.optimism.io/terms) / (https://www.optimism.io/community-agreement). This is just for reference as the governance is similar to Clinic's and DAO in terms of houses, roles and expectations from each role.
